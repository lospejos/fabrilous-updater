**Note:** _In singleplayer you need to OPEN TO LAN your world to access the "/fabdate" command_

# Fabrilous Updater
Minecraft server-side (works in singleplayer!) mod used to check for updates to your Fabric mods.

Note: Only works with mods uploaded to CurseForge or Modrinth.


## Commands
* "/fabdate update" - Shows a list of mods needing updates with a clickable download link. (WORKING)
* "/fabdate ignore"  -  Add, list, or remove mods from an ignore list to prevent update checks. (NOT TESTED)
* "/fabdate autoupdate" - Automatically removes old mods and downloads new mods.  (NOT TESTED)


## How it works:
Using the magic of file hashes, Fabrilous Updater searches through Curseforge and Modrinth to find the latest compatible version.
